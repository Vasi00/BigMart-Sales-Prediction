# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
We have 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities at BigMart.  Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. In this project, I built predictive models using different machine learning algorithms and compare them based on RMSE and MAE. Using these models, we find out the sales of each product at a particular store, which will help in understanding the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
